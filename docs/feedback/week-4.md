# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Fleur
Minute taker: Kenzo
Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* Agenda not on git or Mattermost before meeting.
* Please make sure you have the agenda branch merged in main before the meeting (or at least that it s somewhere on Git).
* Make sure that all previous agendas are also in the repository.
* As mentioned before, please upload the agendas in .pdf or .md. For .docx files I need to download them every time,
and I can not view them directly on GitLab.
* Make sure you clean up your docs folder. You have an "agendas" directory and also a "meetings" one. You have agendas
in both folders (which make it difficult to follow).

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* Notes were not merged in the agenda. The prevoius agenda (week 3 is also not there).
* Please convert the notes to .pdf or .md as well.

#### Chair performance

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* The online setting was not ideal as you could not see/hear everyone. Sometimes I had to intervine and encourage
specific topics/ tell you to move to other topics. 
* As a tip: when you know that a chair will join online, try to find a substitute for that week, as it is difficult to manage a 
meeting if everyone is present to the lab, but the chair. Even if you have the schedule aready set up, you can always make small changes to
it, if it is in the advantage of the team.

#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* You came up with most topics during the meeting and you knew exactly what you wanted to talk about.
* Not everyone was equally active during the meeting. As mentioned before, I expect everyone to contribute miningfully in the meeting.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* I think that developing the controllers + the main screen is a great way to start working on the project.
* Next time don't wait until the end to show me Postman/ GUI.
* Of course, I expect everyone to be involved in this, not just 2 people, so make sure that every week everyone
contributes miningfully on the project. Make sure that you devide the tasks equally and that everyone likes and
agrees with the tasks they are assigned to.
