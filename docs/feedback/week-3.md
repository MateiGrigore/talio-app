# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Kenzo
Minute taker: Maria
Mark: Pass

Feedback: -


#### Agenda 

Mark: Excellent

Feedback: 
* Make sure you merge agenda into main in the day of the meeting (so don't send it in Mattermost anymore)
* Great points for the meeting in the agenda, the meeting was well structured and we had some extra time
for an open discussion on starting to code and what you need to do before you actually start writing code.


#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Notes were merged in the agenda.
* It would be good to includ a list of tasks for each member if it will be discussed in the meeting.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Very Good

Feedback: 
* All topics covered in an appropriate amount of time.
* For future chairs, make sure that you encourage everyone to talk during the meetings, as today not everyone
was equally involved.
* The agenda covered all expected topics.


#### Attitude & Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* You came up with most topics during the meeting (of course, the discussion in the end was not predicted but it was
based on the questions that you asked)
* Not everyone was active during the meeting. Next week I expect everyone to contribute miningfully.
* It was great to see that most you were familiar with the feedback that I have provided for backlog + CoC, and prepared questions
about it.

#### Potentially Shippable Product

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* Not applicable (yet)
* Make sure you have this item in mind for the future meetings
