# Meeting

#### Meeting Organization

Chair: Horia 
Minute taker: Karol

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Very good. Make sure that for every meeting the chair and minute taker are aware of their roles beforehand.


#### Agenda

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* This was the first meeting for which I have requested the agenda. From now on make sure you upload them on GitLab,
in the docs directory. Please make sure that in the future you send the agenda before the meeting. 
* Format: I didn't mind that you changed a bit the format, as long as it is clear and you can lead the meeting it is perfect.
* Content: in terms of planning the time you did great, the estimates were really good and the meeting was well structured.
* Content: you had a lot of questions during the meeting, can you make sure that you write down in the agenda any questions that come up before the meeting?

#### Performance of the *Previous* Minute Taker

Mark: Insufficient/ Does not apply

Feedback: 
* The previous week you did not have a minute taker (which is fine). From now on it is important that the Minute Taker posts the notes in a nice format,
easy to read in the team repository.


#### Chair performance

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* All topics were covered, the timings were good (it is important to plan your meetings well as in the next weeks we will have even more topics to discuss about/
 you'll have more questions + also decide what do you want to do in the meeting with me).


#### Relation

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Most people were very active and listened to the others carefully during the meeting which is very important.
* Make sure everyone is equally involved in the meetings.
