### Planning

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* More topics to think about:
	- do you want someone named as responsible for submitting deliverables?
	- will you set some soft deadlines within the team to make sure that the final deadline is met?
* It's ok to say that you trust people, but is that enough? I think it is essential to have some kind of
plan to ensure that (eg: soft deadlines, meeting halfway through the sprint to check on the progress...)
