### Backlog

### Submission

Mark: Pass

Feedback: Submission looks good!


### Backlog Structure

Mark: Pass

Feedback: 
* You follow the structure but not fully (I assume that you did not look at the course website after the description of the assignment was updated. I suggest you 
take a look there before reading the feedback so it makes more sense. Also please follow the structure from that description, even if now it does not perfectly 
match the backlog example from last year).
* You have sections for stakeholders and terminology which is great, but you are missing the epics


### Epics

Mark: Insufficient

Feedback: 
* "Start by identifying the high-level epics that represent the features of the application"
* MUST HAVES = minimal app epic; for the rest, you have to find ways to group them to give them a name + description
* As mentioned above, read the assignment description.
* Also don't forget to prioritize the epics as well.
* See slides 18,24 from requirements-engineering-slides.pdf
* You don't need to prioritize them using the MoSCoW anymore but keep in mind that the epics need to be ordered in
a prioritized manner (-> you can deduce this from the MoSCoW)

### User Stories

Mark: Good

Feedback: 
* Format: great everywhere! you follow the who/what/why format and you are consistent.
* The user stories look good overall, but you do miss a few important requirements for the advanced features: 
	- make sure you don't have gaps in the user's workflow and that you consider all possibilities of actions.
	- eg: does your app only allow users to join one board (?) -> it is not clear that they can
* After you identify the epics, you might find even more requirements to add, make sure that each epic has a good amount of
user stories that describe it.



### Acceptance Criteria

Mark: Sufficient

Feedback: 
* Some user stories are a bit vague/too big (eg: must haves - 3rd story: multiple users + updating -> split this. 4th story: synchronization + up-to-date -> 3 and 4 somehow overlap and we don't want user stories to overlap)
* Other examples: 
	- 5th req: drag/drop: (this one needs more clear acceptance criteria - do you want to allow this within the same list, in between boards?)
	- 7th req: too many things in 1 req -> cards + lists -> split them
(You get the idea I think.. you can read the assignment description from the website for more information on this.)
